Project Description:
The Pair Programming Matcher will provide a solution for all those problems that commonly arise while trying to collaborate with other programmers. This application will focus on skill level analysis, preference analysis, and project requirements analysis in order to provide the best matches for pair programming. By paying attention to technical experience, experience levels, and soft skills compatibility, it enhances collaboration, unifies project goals, and yields better deliverables. Future development includes AI-based dynamic matching, higher value in data collection, and GitHub and Slack integrations.
